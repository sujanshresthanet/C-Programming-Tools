Simple C Programs
=================

Description
-----------

This repository contains a C program that offers a menu-driven interface allowing the user to select various tasks, such as checking whether a number is positive or negative, finding prime numbers in a range, calculating factorials, checking if a number is Armstrong or Palindrome, and more.

### Features:

*   Hello World Program
*   Check if a number is positive or negative
*   Reverse a number using recursion
*   Find the greatest of three numbers
*   Print Fibonacci series
*   Calculate factorial of a number
*   Find prime numbers in a range
*   Check Armstrong number
*   Check Palindrome number
*   Display palindrome numbers in a range
*   Find the ASCII value of a character
*   Find the size of different data types (int, float, double, char)
*   Sum of first N natural numbers
*   Print the integer entered by the user

How to Run
----------

1.  **Clone or Download the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
    
    git clone https://github.com/sujanshresthanet/C-Programming-Tools.git
    
    Or download it as a ZIP and extract the files.
2.  **Compile the C Program:** Navigate to the directory where the `simple-programs.c` file is located. Compile the program using the `gcc` compiler. Run the following command:
    
    gcc simple-programs.c -o simple-programs -lm
    
    The `-lm` flag is necessary to link the math library, which is used by functions like `sqrt` and `pow`.
3.  **Run the Executable:** Once compiled, you can run the program with the following command:
    
    ./simple-programs
    
4.  **Use the Menu:** The program will display a menu with different options. Enter the corresponding number to perform the desired operation.
