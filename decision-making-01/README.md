C Program Practice
===========================

Project Overview
----------------

This project contains a C program that allows the user to choose from various options for practicing decision-making and loop operations. The program includes tasks such as checking whether a number is odd or even, checking if an alphabet is a vowel or consonant, generating a multiplication table, displaying the alphabet from 'A' to 'Z', and more.

Features
--------

*   Check if a number is odd or even.
*   Determine whether an alphabet is a vowel or consonant.
*   Check if a year is a leap year.
*   Generate a multiplication table for a number.
*   Display characters from 'A' to 'Z'.
*   Colorful user inputs and outputs using ANSI escape codes.

How to Run
----------

### Prerequisites

*   A C compiler (e.g., GCC) installed on your system.
*   A terminal or command-line interface (CLI) that supports ANSI escape codes (for colored output).

### Steps to Run

1.  **Clone the repository** (or copy the source code) to your local machine.
2.  **Open a terminal** and navigate to the directory containing the C source file.
3.  **Compile the program** using a C compiler (e.g., GCC) by running the following command:
    
        gcc program.c -o program
    
4.  **Run the program** by executing the following command:
    
        ./program
    
5.  The program will display a menu where you can select various options to practice decision-making and loops.

Example of Output
-----------------

The program will display a menu like this:

    
    === C Program Practice Menu ===
    1. Check if number is odd or even
    2. Check whether an alphabet is vowel or consonant
    3. Check leap year
    4. Generate multiplication table
    5. Display characters from 'A' to 'Z'
    6. Exit
    
    Enter your choice (1-6):
            

After choosing an option, the corresponding result will be displayed with colorful output in the terminal.
