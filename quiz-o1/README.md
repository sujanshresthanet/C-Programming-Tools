Code Overview
-------------

### Main Program Flow

1.  The program initializes a set of 15 questions, each with 4 options and a correct answer.
2.  It iterates through each question, displays it, and waits for the user to input their answer.
3.  The program validates the input, checks if it's correct, and updates the score.
4.  After all the questions are answered, the final score is displayed.
5.  Based on the score, the program gives feedback.

### Key Functions

*   **displayQuestion()**: This function displays a single question along with its answer options.
*   The main loop in `main()` controls the flow of the quiz, handles user input, and displays feedback for each question.

How to Run the Program
----------------------

### Prerequisites

*   A C compiler such as GCC.
*   A terminal/command prompt for compiling and running the program.

### Steps to Compile and Run

1.  **Download or Clone the Code:** Download the `quiz.c` file or clone the repository if you have Git set up.
2.  **Open the Terminal or Command Prompt:** Navigate to the directory where `quiz.c` is located.
3.  **Compile the Code:** If you are using GCC, run the following command to compile the code:
    
        gcc quiz.c -o quiz
    
4.  **Run the Program:** After compilation, run the program using:
    
        ./quiz
    
5.  **Answer the Questions:** The program will ask a series of questions. For each question, input your answer by typing `A`, `B`, `C`, or `D` and pressing `Enter`.
6.  **View Your Results:** At the end of the quiz, the program will display your final score along with a message based on your performance.
