### Explanation of the Code:

*   The program defines four functions (`add()`, `subtract()`, `multiply()`, and `divide()`) that perform basic arithmetic operations on two floating-point numbers.
*   In the `main()` function:
    *   A loop repeatedly displays a menu asking the user for their choice of operation.
    *   The program accepts two numbers from the user and performs the selected operation.
    *   It continues until the user selects "5" to exit.

### Steps to Run the Program:

1.  **Write the code**: Open any C programming editor (like Visual Studio Code, Code::Blocks, or even a basic text editor) and copy the above code into a new file. Save it with the `.c` extension (e.g., `calculator.c`).
2.  **Compile the code**:
    *   If you are using a command line/terminal, you need to have a C compiler (like GCC or Clang) installed on your computer.
    *   Open a terminal/command prompt, navigate to the folder where you saved your `calculator.c` file, and compile it with the following command:
        
        `gcc calculator.c -o calculator`
        
    *   This will create an executable file named `calculator` (or `calculator.exe` on Windows).
3.  **Run the program**:
    *   After compiling, run the program using the following command:
        
        `./calculator # on Linux/Mac 
        calculator.exe # on Windows`
        
4.  **Use the calculator**:
    *   The program will display a menu where you can select the operation (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide).
    *   Input two numbers when prompted, and the program will display the result.
    *   You can exit the calculator by choosing the option `5`.
