C Pattern Program
=================

This C program generates a variety of patterns using numbers and stars. Each pattern is displayed in a specific shape, such as triangles, pyramids, and other geometric figures. The code uses loops and conditional statements to print these patterns to the console.

Patterns Overview
-----------------

The following patterns are generated by this program:

1.  **Pattern 1:** Right angle triangle with numbers incrementing.
2.  **Pattern 2:** Inverted right angle triangle with numbers.
3.  **Pattern 3:** Right angle triangle with numbers and spaces on the right side.
4.  **Pattern 4:** Right angle triangle with numbers in reverse order.
5.  **Pattern 5:** Right angle triangle of stars.
6.  **Pattern 6:** Inverted right angle triangle of stars.
7.  **Pattern 7:** Right angle triangle of stars with spaces on the right side.
8.  **Pattern 8:** Inverted right angle triangle of stars with spaces.
9.  **Pattern 9:** Right angle triangle of stars, filling the left side.
10.  **Pattern 10:** Inverted right angle triangle with stars on the left.
11.  **Pattern 11:** Right angle triangle with the same number repeated.
12.  **Pattern 12:** Right angle triangle of stars and spaces.
13.  **Pattern 13:** Full star pyramid.
14.  **Pattern 14:** Inverted full star pyramid.
15.  **Pattern 15:** Number pyramid (ascending order).
16.  **Pattern 16:** Inverted number pyramid.
17.  **Pattern 17:** Hollow square with stars.
18.  **Pattern 18:** Hollow pyramid with stars.
19.  **Pattern 19:** Right-angle triangle of alternating stars and spaces.
20.  **Pattern 20:** Alternating number and stars in a right angle triangle.
21.  **Pattern 21:** Increasing stars pattern.
22.  **Pattern 22:** Decreasing stars pattern.
23.  **Pattern 23:** Diamond pattern with stars.
24.  **Pattern 24:** Hollow diamond pattern with stars.
25.  **Pattern 25:** Hourglass pattern with stars.

How to Run the Program
----------------------

### 1\. Prerequisites

Before running the program, ensure you have the following tools installed:

*   **C Compiler:** GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) or any C compiler available on your system.
*   **Text Editor:** A text editor to edit your C program, such as Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, or Notepad++.

### 2\. Compile the Program

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the C file is saved. To compile the program using GCC, run the following command:

    gcc -o patterns patterns.c

Here, `patterns.c` is the name of your C source file. This will generate an executable file named `patterns`.

### 3\. Run the Program

After successful compilation, run the program using the following command:

    ./patterns

This will execute the program and print all the patterns to the console.

Example Output
--------------

Hereâ€™s an example of the output for some of the patterns:

    Pattern 1:
    1 
    1 2 
    1 2 3 
    1 2 3 4 
    1 2 3 4 5

    Pattern 2:
    1 2 3 4 5 
    1 2 3 4 
    1 2 3 
    1 2 
    1

    Pattern 5:
    * 
    * * 
    * * * 
    * * * * 
    * * * * *
