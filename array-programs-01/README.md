Array Programs in C
===================

This C program provides several operations for working with arrays. The user can choose from a list of array operations such as sorting an array, finding the largest element, calculating the sum of array elements, and more. Additionally, it includes a Tic Tac Toe game implemented using a 2D array.

List of Operations
------------------

*   Sort array in ascending order
*   Find the largest element of the given array
*   Find the sum of array elements
*   Find the number of elements in the array
*   Calculate average using array
*   Tic Tac Toe game using 2D Array
*   Swap first and last elements of an array
*   Exit the program

How to Run the Code:
--------------------

To compile and run the program, follow these steps:

1.  **Step 1:** Save the code in a file named `array-programs.c`.
2.  **Step 2:** Open a terminal (or command prompt) in the directory where the file is saved.
3.  **Step 3:** Compile the program using the GCC compiler by running the following command:
    
    gcc array-programs.c -o array-programs
    
4.  **Step 4:** Run the program by typing the following command:
    
    ./array-programs
    

Menu Options:
-------------

When the program runs, the user will see the following menu to choose an operation:

\=== Array Operations Menu ===
1. Sort array in ascending order
2. Find the largest element of the given array
3. Find the sum of array elements
4. Find the number of elements in an array
5. Calculate average using array
6. Tic Tac Toe using 2D Array
7. Swap first and last elements of an array
8. Exit
Enter your choice:
    

Explanation of Functions:
-------------------------

*   **Sort array in ascending order:** This function sorts the array in ascending order using the bubble sort algorithm.
*   **Find largest element of the array:** It finds the largest element in the array by iterating through the elements.
*   **Find sum of array elements:** This function calculates the sum of all elements in the array.
*   **Find number of elements in an array:** The user inputs the number of elements, and the program displays the count of elements.
*   **Calculate average using array:** This function calculates the average of all elements in the array by dividing the sum by the number of elements.
*   **Tic Tac Toe using 2D Array:** This function implements a simple Tic Tac Toe game where two players can make moves by selecting numbers between 1 and 9.
*   **Swap first and last elements of an array:** This function swaps the first and last elements of the array.

Sample Output:
--------------

Here is an example of the programâ€™s output when running the array operations:

3. Find the sum of array elements
4. Find the number of elements in an array
5. Calculate average using array
6. Tic Tac Toe using 2D Array
7. Swap first and last elements of an array
8. Exit
Enter your choice: 1
Enter the number of elements in the array: 5
Enter the elements of the array: 12 5 7 19 3
Sorted Array: 3 5 7 12 19
